This is how to clean up files that used to be tracked but
now you want to put them in .gitignore:

1) add the file name to the .gitignore file

2) remove everything from the cache => $ git rm -r -- cached . <filename>

	=> I suspect this is wrong.  It works, but I suspect you can 
	=> get rid of the . and just put the file name.  Try it sometime.

3) Re add everything to cache with => $ git add .

4) do a commit => $ git commit -m ".gitignore fix"
